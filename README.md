# Video Search

## Features
Video search application using YouTube's API I completed for the Modern React and Redux course. 
It contains boilerplate code by Stephen Grider for quickly getting started with React and Redux.

Disclaimer: Some aspects of YouTube API change over time which can sometimes produce unexpected browser playback errors. This is normal and is usually fixed when Google deploy a server side patch.

### Basic setup
To start from scratch checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:
```
> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> npm install
> npm start
```

### Changelog
- Added lodash and youtube search dependencies.
- Added live reloading to webpack config.

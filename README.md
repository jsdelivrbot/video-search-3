# Video Search

## Features
Video search application using YouTube's API I completed for the Modern React and Redux course. 
It contains boilerplate code by Stephen Grider for quickly getting started with React and Redux.

Disclaimer: Some aspects of YouTube API change over time which can sometimes produce unexpected browser playback errors. This is normal and is usually fixed when Google deploy a server side patch.

### Basic setup
